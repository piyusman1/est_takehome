## Running the App
- Install Docker
- `docker-compose build`
- `docker-compose up`

- Go to http://localhost:3000
- (If want to access backend) Go to http://localhost:5000/images

## Notes and Citations
- Used http://placehold.it/ to generate dummy images with only texts
- Have taken help from medium.com for docker-compose yaml files syntax
- Have taken help from Adobe react spectrum documentation for the icons https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/workflow-icons.html
- Have taken help from https://medium.com/@natnael.awel/how-to-setup-testing-for-typescript-with-express-js-example-83d3efbb6fd4 for jest and supertest setup
- Also taken help from stackoverflow for some syntax and setup errors
- Taken help from google for css grid `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);` to keep 4 images in one row

## Assumptions
- User can click multiple times on thumbs up and thumbs down buttons.
- App will keep the count of it and keep tracking it.
- When the browser is refreshed the count is still there for a new user since the count is updated in the backend.
- Did not use the database only one list of image object. 
- Created APIs and updated the thumbsUp and thumbsDown accordingly using the image id.

## Tech stack used
- Frontend
  - React & Typescript and Adobe React spectrum for the thumbsup and down icons
- Backend
  - Node, express, typescript and jest and supertest for tests

## Design

### Frontend
<img width="1716" alt="Screenshot 2024-03-11 at 6 13 52â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/piyusman1/est_takehome/assets/21041950/bc0b6b9e-57d2-4964-a146-1778ae6b3850">
12 hardcoded images with thumbs up and down button for each images with the count

### Backend 

Three apis: 
- One to fetch all images
- other two to update the thumbsup and down count
- No database used only a list objects

### List of available APIs
